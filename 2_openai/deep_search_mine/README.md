# Deep Research Agent

An AI-powered research assistant that performs web searches, writes comprehensive reports, and sends them via email.

## Features

- **Intelligent Planning**: Uses AI to plan relevant web searches
- **Concurrent Searching**: Performs multiple searches in parallel
- **Cited Research**: All reports include proper citations and source URLs
- **Report Writing**: Synthesizes findings into a comprehensive, well-referenced report
- **References Section**: Every report ends with a complete list of sources
- **Email Delivery**: Optional email delivery to your inbox

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here

# For email (choose one):
# Option 1: Resend API (recommended, works everywhere)
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key

# Option 2: Gmail SMTP (local only, doesn't work on HF Spaces)
GMAIL_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python deep_research.py
```

## Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

‚úÖ **Email Now Works on Hugging Face Spaces!** We use Resend API which works via HTTP instead of SMTP.

### Option 1: Using Gradio CLI

```bash
uv run gradio deploy
```

When prompted, enter these secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key (get free key at https://resend.com)

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Create a new Space on Hugging Face
2. Upload all Python files
3. Upload `requirements.txt`
4. In Settings ‚Üí Repository secrets, add:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`

## How to Get Resend API Key (Recommended)

1. Go to https://resend.com and sign up (free tier available)
2. Verify your email
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)
6. Add it to your `.env` file or Hugging Face Secrets

**Free tier includes:**

- 100 emails/day
- 3,000 emails/month
- Perfect for demos and personal projects!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitation:**

- Free tier can only send to your verified email address
- To send to any email address, you need to verify a domain at https://resend.com/domains
- Alternative: Use Gmail SMTP (works locally for any email) or just display reports in UI

## How to Get Gmail App Password (For Local Use - Optional)

If you prefer to use Gmail SMTP locally instead of Resend:

1. Go to Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification (must be enabled)
3. App Passwords ‚Üí Create new app password
4. Copy the generated 16-character password
5. Use this password (not your regular Gmail password)

**Note:** The app will automatically try Resend first, then fall back to Gmail SMTP if available.

## Usage

1. Enter your research topic in the text box
2. **Optional:** Enter your email address if you want to receive the report via email
3. Click "üöÄ Run Research"
4. Watch the progress updates in real-time
5. The final report will be displayed in the UI

**Email Options:**

- **With email:** Report is displayed AND sent to your inbox
- **Without email:** Report is only displayed in the UI (no email sent)

This makes the app perfect for quick research without needing email delivery!

## Architecture

- **PlannerAgent**: Analyzes query and plans relevant web searches
- **SearchAgent**: Executes web searches concurrently and captures source URLs with citations
- **WriterAgent**: Synthesizes research into a comprehensive report with proper inline citations and a References section
- **EmailAgent**: Formats and sends the report via email (optional)
- **ResearchManager**: Orchestrates the entire workflow

## Report Quality

Every research report includes:

- ‚úÖ Inline citations using [1], [2], [3] format
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive References section at the end
- ‚úÖ Source URLs for every factual claim
- ‚úÖ Professional academic-style formatting
- ‚úÖ 1000+ words of detailed analysis

## Technology Stack

- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Gradio (UI)
- Python asyncio (concurrent execution)
- Resend API (email delivery - works on all platforms)
- Gmail SMTP (email delivery fallback for local use)
