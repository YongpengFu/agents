# Research Report: AI Agent Frameworks in 2025

## Executive Summary

The AI agent landscape is rapidly evolving with several major frameworks emerging [1].
Market analysis suggests significant growth potential in this sector [2][3].

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence agents have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years.
According to industry reports [1], the global AI agent market is expected to reach
$XX billion by 2027 [2]. This report examines the latest trends and frameworks.

## Major Frameworks

### LangGraph

LangGraph has emerged as a leading framework for building stateful AI agents [4].
The framework provides advanced state management capabilities [5] and integrates
seamlessly with LangChain [6].

### CrewAI

CrewAI focuses on multi-agent orchestration [7]. Recent benchmarks show impressive
performance in collaborative tasks [8].

### AutoGen

Microsoft's AutoGen framework offers powerful conversation patterns [9]. The framework
has gained significant traction in enterprise applications [10].

## Market Analysis

The market for AI agent frameworks is experiencing rapid growth. Industry analysts
predict a CAGR of XX% over the next five years [11]. Key drivers include increased
automation demand [12] and improved LLM capabilities [13].

## Conclusion

AI agent frameworks are transforming how we build intelligent systems. The combination
of improved orchestration [14], better state management [15], and enhanced reasoning
capabilities [16] positions these frameworks for widespread adoption.
